### Summary
I graduated from Belarusian State University, Faculty of Economics in 2014. Then I worked as an estimate engineer for 5 years. 
I became interested in programming on maternity leave 2 years ago. And I really liked it, so I successfully completed the course "Frontend developer" in 2019.
Now I have plans to improve knowledge in front-end development and get a job in a dynamic growing company in which I can develop further.
